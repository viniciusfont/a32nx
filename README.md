## About

The A32NX Project is a community-driven open source project to create a free Airbus A320neo in Microsoft Flight Simulator that is as close to reality as possible. It aims to enhance the default A320neo by improving the systems depth and functionality to bring it up to payware-level, all for free.

The following aircraft configuration is currently simulated:

 ```
 Model      A320-251N
 Engine     LEAP 1A-26
 FMGS       Honeywell Pegasus II
 FWC Std.   H2F9E
 ```

Please note that this configuration may change in the future as the A32NX project evolves and changes.

## Installation

### Please follow ALL steps in this README if you encounter any issues with installation before seeking support.

Open the zip that you downloaded from one of the links above, and drag the A32NX folder inside the zip into your Community folder.

See below for the location of your Community folder:

For the Microsoft Store edition AND/OR Gamepass edition:
- Copy the "A32NX" folder into your community package folder. It is located in:
`C:\Users\[YOUR USERNAME]\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.FlightSimulator_<RANDOMLETTERS>\LocalCache\Packages\Community`.

For the Steam edition:
- Copy the "A32NX" folder into your community package folder. It is located in:
`C:\Users\[YOUR USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft Flight Simulator\Packages\Community`.

- Copy the "A32NX" folder into your community package folder. It is located in:
`C:\Users\[YOUR USERNAME]\AppData\Local\MSFSPackages\Community`.

If the above methods do not work:
- You can find your community folder by going into FS2020 general options and enabling developer mode. You will see a menu appear on top. Go to tools and virtual file system. Click on watch bases and your community folder will be listed in one of the folders.
- Please make sure you're copying the "A32NX" folder into your community package folder, NOT the "flybywiresim-a32nx" folder.

## Known Issues (Please note that most issues are being worked on and some of them may even be fixed in the master branch)

- Captain's PFD may occasionally turn off during flight
- No Smoking switch doesn't use a full range of motion.
- Automatic ECAM page switching has minor bugs.
- AP not following the flight plan (leaking input values affect, but don't disconnect the AP) [Workaround: Set dead-zones for your input device higher] 
- Autopilot goes direct to RWY on APP (same with the default A320) [Workaround: Use DIR to a waypoint or selected heading]
- Upper ECAM displays wrong THR levers position / N1 rating.
- Newly added ASOBO A320 liveries are incompatible with the A32NX mod. 
- Ruder keybindings not working (you have to set your keybinding to rudder axis right and left)
- Wing dips on landing (due to bad transition to direct law in flare, same with the default A320)  [Workaround use minimal aileron input on landing]
- Black screens / unable to start (conflict with another mod/livery or incorrect installation of the A32NX mod, use the [installer](https://api.flybywiresim.com/installer))

## FAQ

**Q: Can I download the aircraft in the current state?**

A: Yes, see [Downloads](#Downloads).

**Q: Where is the plane in-sim?**

A: The mod is added on top of the default A320neo from Asobo. If you want to uninstall it and revert to the original aircraft, just delete the A32NX folder in your community folder.

**Q: What are the liveries available?**

A: All liveries for the default A320 are compatible with the A32NX Mod. You can download some of your favourite liveries at [Flightsim.to](https://flightsim.to).

**Q: When will it be released?**

A: The project is an ongoing rolling release. See [Downloads](#Downloads).

**Q: When is the next update?**

A: We don't know, since it depends on many factors. We will announce each Stable build update via [discord](https://discord.gg/flybywire) and our social media: [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/FlyByWireSimulations), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FlybywireSim).

**Q: How do I join the team?**

A: Head over to [Contributing.md](.github/Contributing.md) and join our Discord to get started.

**Q: Is it payware?**

A: No, it is a completely free aircraft, open-source.

**Q: How do we report bugs?**

A: Report bugs to us in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/flybywire), under the #help channel, or by creating a GitHub issue. Just make sure to search for existing issues first before creating a new one.

**Q: Why is my version not the same as what I see others using?**

A: We have two versions, the Stable and Developer (Master). The Stable version is a 'snapshot' of the development which we regard as stable with the current version of the simulator. The Developer build is updated daily and is a constant work in progress and although we test thoroughly each update, minor issues may occur from time to time. If you find this to be the case, you can report these issues in #help in discord or via GitHub Issues (Check there is not an existing issue of the same nature as yours).
